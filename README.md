Image Art - A Creative Visual Experience

About (Image Art)
Our project is a creative exploration of turning images into vibrant art using Turtle graphics. The application draws images with various turtle shapes and sizes, enhancing bright red pixels for a more dynamic visual representation. Overall, this program offers a fun and interactive way to visualize images through turtle graphics.

Image Selection:
Users can specify an image file (e.g., image1.gif, image2.gif, or image3.gif) by changing the filename in the code. The program processes the selected image, creating a colorful output based on the pixels' colors.

Color Enhancement:
The application focuses on enhancing bright red pixels, adjusting their colors to make them stand out even more. This feature is designed to create a visually appealing art piece, drawing attention to vibrant colors in the image.

Turtle Shapes and Sizes:
The program utilizes six different turtle shapes and randomizes their sizes, providing a unique visual output for each run. The turtles' sizes vary from small to large, adding an artistic flair to the representation of the image.

Background Color:
The background color changes based on the selected image. For instance, images image1.gif and image2.gif will display a white background, while image3.gif will feature a black background, creating contrast and enhancing the visual effect.

How to Run It?
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the Pillow library using pip:
bash
pip install Pillow
Download the project files, including main.py and image.py, and place your image files in the same directory.
Open main.py in your preferred Python IDE or editor.
Change the filename variable to one of the available image files.
Run the main.py script. A Turtle graphics window will pop up displaying the image art.

In summary, the "Image Art" application combines creativity, programming, and visual aesthetics to provide users with a fun and engaging way to experience images through Turtle graphics. It encourages experimentation with colors and shapes, fostering a unique artistic expression.
